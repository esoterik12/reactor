This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with
[`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

This project is based of a starter template for a Next.js application with the
following features:

- NextAuth (ususally Google Provider) sign in and out (this requires
  reconfiguration in .evn.local)
- Light and dark theme with next-themes
- Custom tailwind css classes that can be adjusted in globals.css
- `/design` page to visualize basic color, font, text size, button, container
  design choices
- Basic layout, containers, buttons, providers, and some other shared React
  components
- PageContainer contains `h-[calc(100vh-56px)]` to fit the current NavBar height
- Contains disableHydrationWarning to prevent error with next-themese
  (alternative onMount solution commented out)

This should be easy to copy and update dependencies and quickly begin a new
project

### NextAuth

- Deploy the app and register on google cloud console
- get GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID and GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET on google cloud console
- Loosely follows the docs: https://next-auth.js.org/getting-started/example
- install next-auth
- set NEXTAUTH_SECRET in .env.local (generate a key)
- Set NEXTAUTH_URL (localhost for dev) in .env.local (update for deployment)
- create /lib/authOptions.ts and add GoogleProvider
- Create a file `route.ts` in the folder `/app/api/auth/[â€¦nextauth]`
- Add <SessionProvider> to layout.tsx (in a custom client component) - provides
  client access to the session
- Create custom buttons using { signIn } from 'next-auth/react' (and signOut)
- Client-side: <UseSession> provides name, email, and image
- Server-side: <UseServerSession> provides the same, used in server actions
- MongoDB integration requires adding callbacks to `authOptions`, type extension
  of session in `next-auth.d.ts` (add
  `"typeRoots": ["./types", "./node_modules/@types"]` to `tsconfig.json`). The
  callbacks get a userId from mongo or make a new user entry with an id and
  store the id in the session for access on client-side.

- NextAuth server session is accessed in content/layout.tsx and provided down to
  the client though AccordionStack.tsx

### MongoDB / Mongoose Integration

### OpenAI GPT API

- OpenAI:
  - OPENAI_API_KEY
- App will require an advanced model for content generation
- GPT API call is handled in `/lib/actions/generateContent.ts` server action
- This function uses messages in `/lib/gpt-messages/` in a
  `processInputContent.ts` server action to create a message for each activity
  and send it to the API

### prettier and prettier plugin for tailwind

- npm install -D prettier prettier-plugin-tailwindcss

### Taiwlind custom classes:

- Tailwind custom classes for text in `/app/global.css`
- Includes text colors, container colors, text sizing, effects and borders

### Theme support:

- Add darkMode: 'class' to tailwind.config.ts
- npm i next-themes
- wrap layout in <ThemeProvider>
- Add attribute='class' defaultTheme='dark' props to ThemeProvider

### ReduxToolKit

- Redux state providers are only applied through the /content/layout.tsx and not
  through the App wide providers component
- The layout.tsx also accesses the user object and passes it to the client side
  through AccordionStack.tsx to use in context

### Content forms: react-hook-form

- Content forms are based around `/input/ContentForm.tsx` (based on
  react-hook-form and zod)
- The form takes a formType to determine if it is a manual or generated version
- It takes a zodSchema that can be applied to:
  - primaryInput
  - secondaryInput
- Both inputs are designing to simply take strings and this should be sufficient
  for the input of 90% of content generation pages
- ContentForm takes `info` content which is used to provide some titles and
  tooltip content to guide usage

#### New Input Type Process:

1. Create a new page.tsx in a matching folder
2. Add the content top the sidebar constants `AccordionSidebarContent.tsx`
3. Create a new icon for the page and and add it to `ContentForm.tsx`
4. Add new content into into `/lib/constants/content` - add to ContentForm
5. Use existing or create new schemas in `/lib/zod` - add to ContentForm
6. Use existing or create new edit types/schema in `/lib/zod` - add to page
   content state
7. Use appropriate edit form or create a new one in `page.tsx`
8. Create new return structure in `/lib/constants/return-structure`
9. Create new message in `/lib/gpt-messages`
10. Add message and input data to relevant `/lib/actions`
11. Add case to `processInputContent.ts`

### react-pdf

useBlobDownloader.tsx @react-pdf/renderer provides StyleSheet to create
basePageStyles.ts and content-specific styling react-pdf has a few limitations
and cannot use all CSS styles server rendered PDFs are made in `/components/pdf`
folder

1. Create a tsx component that imports required react-pdf components from @react-pdf/renderer. This can be server comp. It will produce the pdf with jsx
2. Create a route.tsx (so it can handle MyDocument.tsx) POST function that
   recieves a Request and returns a Promise<Response>
- Get the body from request.json()
- Validate etc.
- use renderToBuffer from `@react-pdf/renderer` to create pdfBuffer
  - pdfBuffer is a Buffer object that contains the binary data of the PDF
    (Buffer is a Node.js global object used to handle binary data directly) - this cannot be embedded or transmitted within JSON or HTML without encoding (It is possible to use Server Actions, but as far as I can tell this does not allow returning the pdfBuffer without encoding)

3. Create a custom hook to handle blob downloads (using useRef)

4. Create a client-side component to handle the download
- async function that uses the fetch api (`/api/generate-pdf`)
- use fetch api method .blob to convert response data into blob object (Binary Large OBject)'

5. Add fonts to `public` folder if being used in style sheet
- Fonts will need to use a source path with Font.register: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL

### Edit functionality:

Generated content is stored in state:

- It has a title and its contentType as well as different kinds of data
  representing the generated content -simple: array of objects with wordOne and
  wordTwo / or correctWord and incorrectWord or correctSentence and
  incorrectSentence => sometimes it's short as in a word, sometimes it's long as
  in a sentence -simple: array of sentences (like check up) -complex: array of
  sentence with blank, possible answers, correct answer

Possibly require separate components to edit each content type

Type A1: `correctSpelling` + `memory` + `find your partner` can all uses a 2
cols by X rows grid of short inputs

- Other content: `scrambled words`

Type A2: `grammarMistakes` requires a similar structure to A1, but with 1 col
and grouped correct and incorrect sentence

- Other content: `scrambled sentences`

Type B: `check up` requires a simple 1 col by x row but with long inputs

- Other content: `interview`

Type C: `reviewHunt` requires a complex structure but will be reused as a
multiple choice structure

- Other content

Type D: `bingo` + `scrambled words` + `wordsearch` + `spot it` generated
versions will need an edit word like 5 by X grid

The system:

- A reusable edit page that can be added to the path of each content page
  `/content/contentType/edit`
  - Similar to the content input pages, each edit page will load a zod schema
    that can be passed to the edit component
- A set of input fields (probably using `InptuField.tsx` will work, that takes
  tailwind classes depending on content)
- Create edit components that can be .mapped with generated content like:
  - `EditPairs.tsx` for Type A1 with props like 'cols' or 'rows' depending on
    how the content type A1 or A2
  - `EditSentences.tsx` for Type B - simple single wide input
  - `EditMultipleChoice.tsx` for Type C - long sentence edit, 2x2 grid of
    options, correct answer => above type will require a
- The above edit components will be used in the edit pages


## NOTES:

A work through of how data is being handled to generate a pdf for Riddles

1. generation results are returned
- message, code, error
- result{}: data string[]

2. setContent(generationResults.result.data)
- content in page.tsx is therefore a string[]

3. content passed to EditParagraphsForm - as string[]

4. EditParagraphsForm sets defaultValues as {sentence: generatedContent}
this is required for react hook form
this uses EditSentencesFormValues tpye interface infered from definitions in contentEdit.schema.ts

5. handleSubmitButton (in edit para) gets data which is an object
with prop sentence: string[]

it then JSON.stringify data.sentences as in pdfData.data.content

it sends pdfData (stringify) in the body of POST request to `/api/generate-pdf`

6. generate-pdf extracts pdfData from the body
ALERT in here, content is still a string!

it then JSON.parses the pdfData.data.content into a string[]

7. inputData is passed to MyDocument (which is a dynamically imported PDF.tsx content file - server redndered react-pdf component)
POSSIBLE PROBLEM AREA: the problem here is the inputData being passed
